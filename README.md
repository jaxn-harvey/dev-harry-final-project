Final project for CIS-376 Web Development, Fall 2024.

This website aims to provide a clean and responsive order form to customers at Burger Broker, a local food sthand that specializes in sandwiches and burgers. Upon ordering, a summary of the customer's order appears at the bottom of the page as well as on the console.
